This is from the "Put your package on GitHub" section of:

<https://github.com/jtleek/rpackages>


All packages that are developed by the Leek group will be hosted on GitHub.
The accounts are free and it makes it so much easier to share code/get other
people to help you with your code. Here are the steps to getting your package
on GitHub:

Create a new Github repository with the same name (packagename)
In the packagename directory on your local machine, run the commands: git init
Then run: git remote add origin git@github.com:yourusername/packagename.git
Create a file in the packagename directory called README.md
Run the command: git add *
Run the command: git commit -m 'initial commit'
Run the command: git push -u origin master

In summary:

mkdir packagename
cd packagename
git init
git remote add origin git@github.com:yourusername/packagename.git
git add *
git commit -m 'initial commit'
git push -u origin master
