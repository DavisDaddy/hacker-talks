# What is `git`?

`git` is a version-control system for software.  What's that mean?

## About version control

A version-control system is a system that records changes to a file or
set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.

There is some discussion of the concept at, for instance:

<https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control>

## Features of `git`

There are many version-control systems in the wild.  What are the
distinguishing features of `git`?

From the O'Reilly reference, here are the desirable features of `git`:

  - Facilitate Distributed Development
  - Scale to Handle Thousands of Developers
  - Perform Quickly and Efficiently
  - Maintain Integrity and Trust
  - Enforce Accountability (`git blame...`)
  - Immutability
  - Atomic Transactions
  - Support and Encourage Branched Development (and merging)
  - Complete Repositories
  - A Clean Internal Design
  - Be Free, as in Freedom [and beer]

## The `git` repository model

Some version-control systems operate by keeping a master copy of a
project, with changes in the project indicated by a set of of
differences:

![The "non-git" approach to storing changes to a project](/home/mike/Documents/git/hacker-talks/userland/deltas.png)

Note that, in general, this requires you to have a connection to the
server that stores the master copy.

On the other hand, `git` stores data more like a series of snapshots
of *the entire project*:

![Storing data as snapshots of the project over time](/home/mike/Documents/git/hacker-talks/userland/snapshots.png)

(The dashed lines indicate that `git` is storing only a pointer to an
unchanged file, rather than duplicating the entire file.) This
approach means that operations on a git repository can be and usually
are entirely local, independent of a connection to a master server.

# Installing `git`

Available via your package manager in linux:

    sudo apt-get install git  ## Debian-related systems (Ubuntu)
	sudo dnf install git      ## Redhat-related systems (Fedora)

or in MacOS:

    brew install git          ## Using `homebrew` package mgr

Or (for `Windows` [or other systems]) download directly from the `git` site:

<https://git-scm.com/downloads>

# Using `git`

## The command line

### Summary of usage

Type `git  --help` to see common subcommands and options:

```{bash gitOptions1}

git --help

```

(Actually, typing `git` alone would produce the same output.)

### Help for `git` subcommands

Each `git` subcommand has its own help section:

```{bash gitOptions2}

git commit --help | head

```

(Output truncated for brevity)


## Creating a repository

There are two ways to make a `git` repository (collection of files and
data):

  - Create your own from scratch
  - Copy (clone) from another location

We'll look at each of those in turn.

## Creating your own repository

### First, create a directory, `test` (name is arbitrary)

```{bash createDir}

if [ -d ~/test ]; then
    \rm -rf ~/test
fi

mkdir ~/test    ## Create a sub-dir `test` in my login directory


```

### Next, make a file in the `test` directory and make it executable

```{bash makeFile}

cd ~/test        ## Go to the directory just created

cat <<EOF > hw.py
#!/usr/bin/python

print("Hello from Python")
EOF

chmod +x hw.py    ## make the file executable

```

### Now look at the file and run it, just to verify it's there:

```{bash lookRun1, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}

cd ~/test

cat hw.py  ## display the contents of the file

echo ""

./hw.py    ## run the file

```

### Now make the directory into a `git` repository

```{bash initGit, echo=TRUE}

cd ~/test
git init

```

### Take a look at the "hidden" .git directory and its contents

```{bash lookIntoDotGit}

cd ~/test

ls -a
echo "########"
ls .git

```

### Starting to exercise `git`


Now where are we in `git` land?

```{bash firstGitLook}

cd ~/test
git status

```

So `git` has "noticed" our `hw.py` file ("untracked"), but we haven't
told it what to do with the file.  Note the helpful hint:

    (use "git add" to track)

Before we proceed, let's back up and look at how `git` handles files.

Our file, `hw.py` is currently in the *Working Directory*.  Now we
want to let `git` know that we're seriously interested in this file,
which we do by "adding" the file to the *Staging Area*, a.k.a, the
*Index*.  The point here is that we're required to make a conscious
decision as to what files `git` should track.  For instance, we
probably do *not* want `git` to track the MP3 file that happened to
wind up in our directory by mistake.

### Add a file to the repository

Here we take `git` up on the suggestion to "add" the file.

```{bash addFile1}

cd ~/test
git add hw.py
git status

```

OK, we've got `git` paying real attention to our `hw.py` file.  Now
let's assume we've tweaked and honed our code until it shines like the
top of the Chrysler building, and we won't be making changes to it in
the near future.  We're now ready to "commit" the file to the
repository, which means that `git` will now not only be aware of the
file, but it will store the contents in a "secret" place, and will
store as well various pieces of meta-information about the file.

As a preliminary to the next step, we do some bookkeeping to keep
`git` from asking and/or guessing about this stuff:

```{bash setGlobalGitOpts}

## First some bookkeeping
git config --global user.name "Michael Hannon"
git config --global user.email "jmhannon.ucdavis@gmail.com"

```

The "global" configuration options reside in a file called
`.gitconfig` (note the initial period) in your login directory:

```{bash showConfig}

cd    ## goes to login directory
cat .gitconfig

```

Note that it's also possible to have a *per-repository* `.gitconfig`
file, in case you want to have some `git` options that apply
specifically to the given project.  (And the settings in the
per-repository `.gitconfig` file override those in the global file.)

All set.  Commit the file to the repository:

```{bash commit1}

cd ~/test
git commit -m "Initial contents of our hello-world file" \
           --author="Michael Hannon <jmhannon.ucdavis@gmail.com>"
git status

```

Note that if you omit the commit message (the `-m` option), git will
open an editor for you in which to type the message.  You can choose
the editor to use by setting the `GIT_EDITOR` environment variable.
See the O'Reilly reference for details.

### Further work on our project

Time passes.  You think of a modification you might make to the
`hw.py` file, and you think of another file that might be useful in
this project.  First append a line to the `hw.py` file:

```{bash modProject1}

cd ~/test
echo -e "print('From Davis, in the heart of California.')" >> hw.py

```

Second, make a file to do some calculations:


```{bash modProject2}

cd ~/test

cat <<EOF > calc.py
#!/usr/bin/python

import sys

prog, arg1, arg2, op = sys.argv
val1 = float(arg1)
val2 = float(arg2)

if op == "add": print (val1 + val2)
else:
    print ("Whut?")
EOF

```

We've created the script.  We'll make it executable and run some
examples, just to be sure it's working:

```{bash runNewHw1}

cd ~/test

chmod +x calc.py    ## make the file executable
./calc.py 2 3 add
./calc.py 42 314 logarithm

```

OK, we've got a modified file and a new file.  The next thing to do is
to stage the files and then do a commit:

```{bash modProject1commit}

cd ~/test
git add hw.py calc.py
git commit -m "Better hello-world message; new calculation module."
git status

```

That was easy enough.  Let's review our changes.  First, look at the
log of the commits we've made so far:

```{bash modProject1Review1}

cd ~/test

git log

```

Some further introspection:

```{bash modProject1Review2}

cd ~/test

git diff HEAD HEAD^

```

Here `HEAD` and `HEAD^` are `git` shorthands for the current commit
and the previous commit, respectively.  More about this later.

### `git` to the rescue

One important feature of `git` that we haven't mentioned is the
ability to move gracefully among different versions of stored files
(or sets of stored files).

Here's a simple example.  First, a brief look at our current commits:

```{bash getOldFile1}

cd ~/test
git log --pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit

```

Here are the current contents of our `hw.py` file:

```{bash lookAtCurrentHw}

cd ~/test
cat hw.py

```

Now suppose that we've managed to get confused and mess up our current
`hw.py` to a more-or-less-unrecoverable state.  It would be nice if we
could just start over.  We *can* do that, simply by checking out a
previous version of `hw.py`:

```{bash getOldHw}

cd ~/test
git checkout master~1 hw.py
cat hw.py

```

The notation `master~1` is a shorthand for the first upstream commit
from the current `HEAD` of the `master` branch.

Note that now-checked-out version of `hw.py` does *not* contain the
line about "...the heart of California".

This would be followed by whatever edits, adds, and commits were
required to rectify the problems we had created.

We can also recover from accidental deletions in our working
directory.  Here we (deliberately) remove `hw.py` and restore it from
the repository.  Here's what we start with:

```{bash recoverHw1}

cd ~/test
git checkout -q  master
ls

```

Now we unintentionally remove a file, `hw.py`:

```{bash recoverHw2}

cd ~/test
rm hw.py    #### Didn't mean to do this!!!
ls

```

No problem.  The file is still in the repository:

```{bash recoverHw3}

cd ~/test

git checkout hw.py
ls

```

### Miscellaneous

A few notes:

  - It's possible to use various `git` shenanigans to amend commits,
    checkout entire previous snapshots, etc.  We won't cover these here.
  - Once you have a file in your `git` repository, you should **not**
    use regular shell commands to, for instance, remove it.  Instead
    you would use:
	    `git rm unneeded.txt`
  - There are now *many* GUI front ends for `git`.  Have a look at:
    <https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis>


### Our current status

For our small project we now have:

  - A list of every change we've made
  - The time the change was made
  - The identity of the person that made the change
  - A *universally unique* identifier for the content of each commit
  - The ability to recover lost files and/or previous versions of a
    given file with only a small amount of effort

All the same would be true for a project of arbitrarily-large size
with an arbitrarily-large number of contributors to the project.


**Digression: Globally Unique Identifiers**

    An important characteristic of the SHA1 hash computation is that
    it always computes the same ID for identical content, regardless
    of where that content is. In other words, the same file content in
    different directories and even on different machines yields the
    exact same SHA1 hash ID. Thus, the SHA1 hash ID of a file is an
    effective globally unique identifier.  A powerful corollary is
    that files or blobs of arbitrary size can be compared for equality
    across the Internet by merely comparing their SHA1 identifiers.

(The O'Reilly reference, page 33)

By the way, by my count there are more than **100 options** to the
`git log` command.  In this and other places we've just scratched the
surface.




## Branching and merging -- conceptual view

Once you get a project running, you probably don't want to mess with
it: break something and you may lose customers, for example.

On the other hand, no project is ever perfect, and your competitors
more or less compel you to keep developing.

The traditional response to this dilemma is to copy all your files to
a different directory and make modifications, additions, etc., only in
that new directory.  This does work, of course, but the bookkeeping
can be cumbersome, particularly if you need to make changes (bug
fixes) to the original at the same time.

The `git` approach makes it relatively straightforward to manage
parallel lines of development.

Here is a series of images that illustrate the idea conceptually:

![Original repository](/home/mike/Documents/git/hacker-talks/userland/orig-repos.png)

Note: there is *always* a branch, and it is called `master` by
default.  (The name can be changed, but that is seldom done.)

Note also: each commit has a pointer to its "ancestor".

![Create new branch to deal with "issue 53"](/home/mike/Documents/git/hacker-talks/userland/issue53.png)


![Make a commit to fix "issue 53"](/home/mike/Documents/git/hacker-talks/userland/issue53change.png)

![Merge master and iss53](/home/mike/Documents/git/hacker-talks/userland/mergemasterandiss53.png)


## Branching and merging -- a concrete example

### Setting up some repositories

We start by creating a new repository and populating it with two
simple files.

First, make the directory and initialize an empty `git` repository:


```{bash makeOrigRepos}

if [ -d ~/test ]; then
    \rm -rf ~/test
fi

mkdir ~/test
cd ~/test

git init

```

Next, create the two files, `hw.py` and `calc.py`:

```{bash createOrigFiles}

cd ~/test

########## hw.py ##########

cat <<EOF > hw.py
#!/usr/bin/python

print("Hello from Python")
EOF

########## calc.py ##########

cat <<EOF > calc.py
#!/usr/bin/python

import sys

prog, arg1, arg2, op = sys.argv
val1 = float(arg1)
val2 = float(arg2)

if op == "add":
    print (val1 + val2)
else:
    print ("Whut?")
EOF

```

Now we run the files, just to confirm that everything is working:

```{bash testOriginalFiles}

cd ~/test

chmod +x hw.py calc.py

./hw.py
./calc.py 42 314 add

```

Everthing looks good, so we `commit` the two files to our `git`
repository:

```{bash makeInitialCommits}

cd ~/test

git add hw.py calc.py
git commit -m "Added the first two files, hw.py and calc.py"

```

Next we make a new branch, `newmath`, and change to that branch:

```{bash newmath}

cd ~/test

git branch newmath
git branch alternate    ########## for later use
git checkout newmath

```

Let's see what we've got on the new branch:

```{bash firstLookAtNewmath}

cd ~/test
ls -l

```

What's *in* the files?


```{bash lookFilesNewmath}

cd ~/test

cat calc.py  #########

echo -e "\n########\n"

cat hw.py    ########

```

At this point the `newmath` branch is a no more than a snapshot of the
`master` branch.

But we have the epiphany that having even more arithmetic operations
in our `calc.py` file would be useful, so we add those, and in the
process we happen to use a slightly different syntax:

```{bash modifyCalc1}

cd ~/test

########## New calc.py ##########

cat <<EOF > calc.py
#!/usr/bin/python

import sys

prog, arg1, arg2, op = sys.argv
val1 = float(arg1)
val2 = float(arg2)

if op == "sum":
    print (val1 + val2)
elif op == "diff":
    print (val1 - val2)
elif op == "prod":
    print (val1 * val2)
elif op == "quot":
    print (val1 / val2)
else:
    print ("Whut?")
EOF

```

Let's check that our new routines are working:

```{bash exerciseNewCalc}

cd ~/test
./calc.py 3 14 sum
./calc.py 5 10 diff
./calc.py 6 7 prod
./calc.py 72 9 quot
./calc.py 42 314 bessel

```

That all looks good, so  we add `calc.py` to the staging area, then
commit it:


```{bash commitNewCalc1}

cd ~/test

git add calc.py
git commit -m "Added some more functions to calc.py, changed op names"

```

## A first look at merging branches

In the scenario above the motivation for creating a branch was that we
wanted to continue tinkering with and developing our software while
our "production" branch stayed stable.

But at some point we'll want to fold all the great new developments
from our `newmath` branch back into our production (`master`) branch,
so that everybody gets the benefit of all our improvements.

The `git merge` command allows us to do that more or less painlessly.
Here's an example:

```{bash mergeNewMath1}

cd ~/test
git checkout master
git merge newmath

```

What has this done for us?  Take a look:

```{bash firstLookAfterBranch}

cd ~/test
git diff HEAD HEAD^

```

The file `calc.py` has been modified, as indicated above.  In fact,
the file `calc.py` in the `master` branch is now identical to the
`calc.py` in the `newmath` branch:

```{bash secondLookAfterBranch}

cd ~/test
git checkout -q master
echo -e "\nNew version of calc.py in master branch ##########\n"
cat calc.py

```

Note that the line for addition was *different* in the two versions of
`calc.py`:

    if op == "add":

versus:

    if op == "sum":

But `git` overwrote the `add` version without pausing to get our
approval.  Why is that?

The answer seems to be as follows. We created `newmath` as a snapshot
of the original `master` branch, with the intention of improving the
stuff on the `master` branch.  We made those improvements on
`newmath`, **without** doing any further work on `master` and then
said, in effect, **give me all those improvements**.  And that's what
we got, including the change in syntax.

In fact, if you look at the topology of the commits, you don't see
anything that looks like a branch: only a linear series of commits.
It's more like we bent the oririnal branch, rather than making a new
one.



## Merging branches II -- conflict arises

Sometimes even `git` is not smart enough to know how to do merging.
Let's look at an example of that.  First, we make a new branch,
`newmsg`:


```{bash newMsgBranch}

cd ~/test
git checkout -q master
git checkout -b newmsg

```

We now proceed to modify our `hw.py` file in the `newmsg` branch:

```{bash modHw1}

cd ~/test

cat <<EOF > hw.py
#!/usr/bin/python

print("newmsg sez: Hello from Python")
EOF

cat hw.py

```

This looks OK, so we proceed to add and commit the new file:

```{bash commitHw1}

cd ~/test
git add hw.py
git commit -m "Tagged the hw.py message with 'newmsg'"

```

We now get an urgent request to modify our working copy of `hw.py` in
the `master` branch.  Perhaps against our better judgment, we proceed
to make the requested change:


```{bash modHw2}

cd ~/test
git checkout -q master

cat <<EOF > hw.py
#!/usr/bin/python

print("master sez: Hello from Python")
EOF

cat hw.py

```

This looks OK as well, so we proceed to add and commit the new file:

```{bash commitHw2}

cd ~/test
git add hw.py
git commit -m "Tagged the hw.py message with 'master'"

```

We've fixed the urgent problem.  Now back to business as usual.  We
want to merge into `master` all the fine work we did on the `newmsg`
branch:

```{bash mergeNewmsg1}

cd ~/test
git checkout -q master
git merge newmsg || true

```

Oops.  What happened here?  Abort the commit and check the logs:

```{bash abortAndLook1}

cd ~/test
git merge --abort
git log --pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit

```

```{bash abortAndLook2}

cd ~/test
git checkout newmsg
git log --pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit

```

Here's a picture:


```{r commitGraph, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=7, fig.height=5}

library(igraph)

layout.matrix <- matrix(rbind(c(-0.2, 0.5),
                              c(0.0,  0.5),
                              c(0.2,  0.5),
                              c(0.4,  0.0)), ncol=2)

layout.matrix <- matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 1, 1, -1), ncol=2)

g1 <- graph.formula(C1+--C2, C2+--C3, C2+--C4)

plot(g1, main="History of Commits",
     vertex.color="lightblue",
     vertex.label.cex=1.8,
     edge.width=5,
     edge.arrow.size=2,
     vertex.size=25,
     vertex.shape="square",
     layout=layout.matrix
     )

```

The gist of the above is that the `HEAD` pointer is pointing to
different commits on the respective branches.  Here's a digression, an
under-the-hood look at that pointer.


## Digression on the mechanics of `git`


```{bash lookAtDotGit}

cd ~/test
ls .git

```

The `.git` directory is the place where all the double-secret `git`
stuff is stored.  One of the files there is `HEAD`, which term is a
synonym for the current commit on a given branch.  Here's what it
looks like on the `master` branch:

```{bash lookAtHEADmaster1}

cd ~/test/
git checkout -q master


```

```{bash lookAtHEADmaster2}

cd ~/test/.git
cat HEAD
cat refs/heads/master


```

Here's the same look on the `newmsg` branch:

```{bash lookAtHEADnewmsg1}

cd ~/test/
git checkout -q newmsg

```

```{bash lookAtHEADnewmsg2}

cd ~/test/.git
cat HEAD
cat refs/heads/newmsg

```

## Merging branches III -- conflict resolved

Returning to the mergeing conflict mentioned above.  We took a
snapshot of our `master` branch when we created the `newmsg` branch.
In our *original* merge scenario, we created a branch (`newmath`),
made some improvements on that branch (more math functions supported),
and then merged `newmath` back into `master`, with no "complaints"
from `git`.

The difference in *this* case, with the `newmsg` branch is that
*after* taking the snapshot of our `master` branch to make
improvements in the `newmsg` branch, we were forced by circumstances
*also* to modify the `master` branch.

In some situations this would not be a problem, and `git` would figure
out what to do without help from us.

But *this* time it so happens that we made *different* improvements in
*exactly* the same piece of code on the respective branches.

Recall that one of the desirable features of `git` is:

    Maintain Integrity and Trust

We certainly couldn't trust `git` if it were to fail silently and/or
make random guesses as to our intentions in the case of conflict.

Hence, `git` doesn't fail silently, but neither does it leave us
grasping for clues as to the source of the conflict.  It *explicitly*
tells us exacty the things it is unable to resolve.  Here's an
example.  Again we attempt to merge our two branches, which is going
to fail, but this time we won't abort the commit: we'll stop and poke
around.

```{bash tryMergeAgain}

cd ~/test
git checkout -q master
git merge newmsg || true

```

As advertised, the commit failed.  Let's have a look at the current
state of the `hw.py` file, the one mentioned in the merge-failure
message.

```{bash exploreConflict}

cd ~/test
cat hw.py

```

The file has been modified by `git` to show the conflict.  The section of the
file starting with:

    <<<<<<< HEAD

indicates the successive line (or lines) is from the version of
`hw.py` on the current `HEAD`, i.e., the `master` branch.

The content from the `master` branch (only one line in this simple
case) continues down to the separator line:

    =======

The content *below* the separator line is the conflicting content from
the other version of `hw.py`, the one on the `newmsg` branch, and this
is indicated by the line at the bottom:

    >>>>>>> newmsg

The next thing to do is just to pick the content we want to keep and
discard the rest (including discarding the `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, and
`>>>>>>>` lines).  We could do this with a text editor (particularly
easy in this simple case), or we could invoke any one of a number of
GUI-based tools to sort out the conflict.

It's hard to show the interactive use of an editor in a static
document, so we'll just re-create `hw.py` with the lines we want to
keep:

```{bash editHwPy}

cd ~/test
cat <<EOF > hw.py
#!/usr/bin/python

print("master sez: Hello from Python")
EOF
echo ""
cat hw.py

```

Now we've resolved the conflict to our satisfaction, so we `add` the
file and commit it:

```{bash finishHwPyConflict}

cd ~/test
git add hw.py
git commit -m "Resovled conflict in hw.py"

```

It's also worth mentioning that the command:

    git diff

is also useful in exploring merge conflicts, but it doesn't provide
any new information in this simple case.

Here's a sketch of the GUI-based approach:

```{bash invokeMergeTool, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}

git mergetool -t meld

```

This brings up some additional dialog:

    Merging:
    hw.py

    Normal merge conflict for 'hw.py':
      {local}: modified file
      {remote}: modified file
    Hit return to start merge resolution tool (meld):

After you hit `return` the following window pops up:

![The meld mergetool](/home/mike/Documents/git/hacker-talks/userland/meld.png)

The three sub-windows are, from left to right:

  - The local (`master`) branch
  - The common ancestor
  - The remote (`newmsg`) branch

You do the editing just by clicking the black arrows to move code to
the place where you want it to go.

There are many mergetools available.  To see a list on your system,
type:

    git mergetool --tool-help

(has to be done in a directory under control of git).



## Cloning (copying) a repository

We've looked at creating and using our own repository.  Another
very-common use of `git` is to copy a repository from elsewhere, a
process referred to as "cloning" in `git` terminology.

Here's the general idea:

    git clone /path/to/repo  /path/to/new/repo # for a repo on the same computer

    git clone username@host:/path/to/repository \ # remote repo
	    [optional path name]

Here are some specific examples.

## Cloning a local repository

First we issue the `clone` command:


```{bash cloneLocal1, eval=TRUE}

cd

if [ -d ~/test2 ]; then
    \rm -rf ~/test2
fi


git clone test test2

```

Now let's go into the cloned directory and have a look around:

```{bash cloneLocal2}

cd ~/test2

git log

git status

```

Note the comment from `git status`:

    Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.

The `origin/master` bit means the branch `master` in the original
repository.  The identity of the original repository is located in the
file:

    .git/config

This is a text file that includes a bunch of information about the
current repository, including, in this case, the lines:

    [remote "origin"]
	    url = /home/mike/test
	    fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*

Note also that we don't seem to have the `newmath` branch in our
`test2` repository.  In fact, the new repository **is** aware of the
`newmath` branch, but it isn't tracking it.

We can see this *and* change this (if we want to) as follows:

```{bash lookAtNewBranch1, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}

cd ~/test2

git branch -a

```

All the branches are there.  We instantiate a `nemath` branch in our
cloned directory:

```{bash connectToOrigNewmath}

cd ~/test2

git checkout -b newmath origin/newmath

```

And check our status:

```{bash checkCloneStatus}

cd ~/test2
git status

```

The point of all this is that we can now keep things up-to-date in
multiple places by using the `git` commands:

    git pull
	git push

(with the proviso that we have already set up the appropriate tracking
information and have already set up the appropriate file permissions).

Here's an example where we make a new file in the `test2` repository
and `push` it back to the `test` repository.

First we make the file:

```{bash makeTheByeFile, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, comment=NA}

cd ~/test2
git checkout master
cat <<EOF > bye.py
#!/usr/bin/python

print("Goodbye, cruel world!")
EOF
chmod +x bye.py

```

Now we push the new file back to the original repository.  Note that
we first have to "close" the `master` branch in the original
repository to avoid confusing the bookkeeping.  (This would not be
necessary if the original were a so-called "bare" repository, a common
arrangement in "real-world" repositories.)


```{bash closeMasteronOrigin}

cd ~/test

git checkout newmath

```

Now we go back to our cloned repository:

```{bash backToCloned}

cd ~/test2

git checkout master

```

Let's have a look at the new file and run it, just to make sure
everything is OK:

```{bash checkTheByeFile}

cd ~/test2
cat bye.py

echo -e "\n########"

./bye.py

```

Things seem OK, so we add and commit the `bye.py` file, as usual:

```{bash addAndCommitBye}

cd ~/test2

git add bye.py

git commit -m "Added a goodbye msg in bye.py"

```

Before proceeding, we set a `git` option so as to avoid an annoying
warning message:

```{bash dontNagAboutPush}

cd ~/test2

git config --global push.default simple

```

Now let's "push" our new file back to the `origin`:

```{bash pushByeback}

cd ~/test2

git push


```

So, did this actually work?  We can check.  First we go back to our
original respository and check out the `master` branch:

```{bash backToOriginMaster}

cd ~/test

git checkout -q master

```

What files do we have now in `origin/master`?

```{bash whatFilesNow}

cd ~/test
ls

```

Aah, there's something there that wasn't there before: `bye.py`.  Does
it work?

```{bash checkThatByeWorks}

cd ~/test

git checkout -q master

./bye.py

```

Yep.


## Cloning a remote repository

A lot of software, documentation, etc., is distributed from web-based
`git` sites (e.g., `github`) these days.  But getting access to this
stuff presents something of a chicken-and-egg problem.  E.g., you
might have to be logged in to `github` to be able to see, hence,
clone, some repositories.

Here's a not-very-interesting clone command:

    git clone git@github.com:DavisDaddy/remoteAdd.git

This simply clones the toy repository discussed in this document.

This will clone into a directory called `remoteAdd`.  If you want it to
go elsewhere, just tack that onto the end, as:

        git clone git@github.com:DavisDaddy/remoteAdd.git theTalk
	
There's not much point in cloning the repository we already have, but
it does demonstrate how easy it is to get information this way.

There typically is a box some place on the project page where you can
copy the clone URL (i.e., `git@github.com:...`).

It's also possible to `fork` a given repository (online or local) so
that you can do your own independent development.  For our purposes
this isn't much different from cloning the repository.

## Pushing content **to** a remote repository

A common mode of operation is to create a `git` repository on your own
computer, do some work on the corresponding project, and then put your
"final" version of the project onto a web server that provides `git`
services so that others can benefit from your work.  The `github` site:

<https://github.com/>

is probably the most-famous such site.

The gist of the idea is to make a repository (aka "project") on the
server with the same name as the name of the directory in which your
repository resides on your own computer, then copy the files from your
local repository to the remote one.  Here's an example.  First we make
a new directory, go there, and initialize an empty `git` repository:


```{bash pushToRemote1, echo=TRUE}

cd                # go to login directory

if [ -d ~/remoteAdd ]; then
    \rm -rf ~/remoteAdd
fi

mkdir remoteAdd   # make your project directory

cd remoteAdd      # go there

git init          # initialize an empty repository

```

Next, we make a new file, `README.md`, then stage and commit the file:

```{bash pushToRemote2, echo=TRUE}

cd ~/remoteAdd

cat <<EOF > README.md		# add the first file
This repository began life on my home PC (linux box)

EOF

git add README.md   # add and commit the file

git commit -m "Initial commit w/README.md"

```

The next step (in building the infrastructure) is to login to the
`github` site:

<https://github.com/>

and make a new repository or "project".  You do this as follows:

Click the green `+ New repository` sign on the right-hand side to
create, well, a new repository.

For the "Repository name" use:

    remoteAdd

I.e., use the same as the name of your local directory (see the `mkdir`
command above).  Leave the rest of the items alone and select the
green `Create repository` button.

After you make the repository, `github` gives you instructions as to how
to proceed.  In this case, we're adding content from our local
directory to the web server.  We add a remote branch and push our
content to it:

```{bash pushToRemoteAndTrack, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}

cd ~/remoteAdd

git remote add origin git@github.com:DavisDaddy/remoteAdd.git
git push -u origin master	# push our master branch to the origin

```

**Important:** You need to substitute *your own* `github` login name
in place of `DavisDaddy` in the above.

The `-u` option sets up "tracking" between the local and remote
branches.  This simplifies the subsequent use of the commands:

    git push
	git pull


We can ask `git` for some details of the set-up:

```{bash showRemote}

cd ~/remoteAdd

git remote -v

```

And some more details:

```{bash showOrigin}

cd ~/remoteAdd

git remote show origin

```

And now just to round out this example, we make an additional file and
push it to `gitlab`:

```{bash makeSecondFileForRemote}

cd ~/remoteAdd

cat <<EOF > millerTale
And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face, at first just ghostly, 
Turned a whiter shade of pale
EOF

```

And now we add and commit as usual:

```{bash addCommitTale}

cd ~/remoteAdd

git add millerTale
git commit -m "Procol Harum -- A Whiter Shade of Pale"

```

Now let's copy the file to the `github` site:

```{bash pushTheTale}

cd ~/remoteAdd

git push


```

## Miscellaneous

### Ignoring files: `.gitignore`

One more thing.  Over the course of time a project typically
accumulates a lot of "cruft": log files, temporary files, etc.  In
addition, there are often files that can easily be regenerated, such
as a PDF document generated from some text-based source file.  We
probably don't want to clutter our repository with those things.

`git` does not *insist* that you include such things, but it will
repeatedly *remind* you that you have unstaged files if you don't
explicitly add them.

You can use a file called `.gitignore` to tell `git` to, well, ignore
such files.  There are many examples of such files in the wild.
There's a long discussion in the `git` help page:

    git help gitignore

Here's a simple example:

```{bash exampleGitIgnore}

cd ~/test

cat <<EOF > .gitignore

# Ignore ...
#   compiled python code
*.pyc

#   editor auto-save files (ending in tilde)
*~

#   html generated from our source docs
*.html

#   except don't ignore our original html file
!orig.html

#   files resulting from compilation
*.o
*.exe

#   log files
*.log

#   everything in the "tmp" subdirectory
tmp/

EOF

```

Here's a simple test.  We add an empty log file to our project
directory, then check to see if `git` "complains" about it.

```{bash useGitIgnore}

cd ~/test

echo -e "Creating an empty log file:\n"
touch junk.log

echo -e "\nThe file shows up in a listing of the directory:\n"
ls

echo -e "\nBut git does not 'see' it:\n"
git status

```

Notice that `git` *did* complain about our newly-created `.gitignore`
file, but it did *not* complain about the log file.
